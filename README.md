Technologies and Tools Used
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the model.
Programming Languages: Python for coding and implementing the algorithms.
Libraries: OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation.
Dataset: Chest X-ray images dataset, such as those provided by the NIH or other medical image repositories.
Key Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Dataset: Collected chest X-ray images labeled as pneumonia or normal.
Preprocessing: Resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting data to improve model robustness.
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Used to address data imbalance by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.

Model Development
Architecture: Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for their effectiveness in image classification tasks.
Training: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's performance.
Implementation

Training Pipeline: Set up a pipeline for training the model, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimented with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Results and Analysis

Model Performance: Achieved high accuracy and strong performance metrics on the test set, indicating effective pneumonia detection.
Visualization: Used confusion matrices, ROC curves, and heatmaps to visualize and interpret model performance.
